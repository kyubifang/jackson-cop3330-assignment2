Exercise 38 - Filtering Values

Sometimes input you collect will need to be filtered down. Data structures and loops can make this process easier.

Create a program that prompts for a list of numbers, separated by spaces. Have the program print out a new list containing only the even numbers.
Example Output

Enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
The even numbers are 2 4 6 8.

Constraints

    Convert the input to an array. Many languages can easily convert strings to arrays with a built-in function that splits apart a string based on a specified delimiter.
    Write your own algorithm—don’t rely on the language’s built-in filter or similar enumeration feature.
    Use a function called filterEvenNumbers to encapsulate the logic for this. The function takes in the old array and returns the new array.

Challenge

    Instead of prompting for numbers, read in lines from any text file and print out only the even-numbered lines.

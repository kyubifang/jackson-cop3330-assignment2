Exercise 40 - Filtering Records

Sorting records is helpful, but sometimes you need to filter down the results to find or display only what youâ€™re looking for.

Given the following data set create a program that lets a user locate all records that match the search string by comparing the search string to the first or last name field.
First Name 	Last Name 	Position 	Separation Date
John 	Johnson 	Manager 	2016-12-31
Tou 	Xiong 	Software Engineer 	2016-10-05
Michaela 	Michaelson 	District Manager 	2015-12-19
Jake 	Jacobson 	Programmer
Jacquelyn 	Jackson 	DBA
Sally 	Webber 	Web Developer 	2015-12-18


Example Output

Enter a search string: Jac

Results:

Name                | Position          | Separation Date
--------------------|-------------------|----------------
Jacquelyn Jackson   | DBA               |
Jake Jacobson       | Programmer        |

Constraint

    Store the data using a list of maps.

Challenges

    Make the search case insensitive.
    Add the option to search by position.
    Add the option to find all employees where their separation date is six months ago or more.
    Read in the data from a file.
